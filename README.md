# User CRUD Admin Panel (Next.js, MUI, React Query, i18n)

A full-featured user management/admin panel built with Next.js 14, Material-UI (MUI), React Query, React Hook Form, Yup validation, and full internationalization (i18n) support. This project demonstrates best practices for building scalable, modern, and accessible admin interfaces.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` â€” Start the development server
- `npm run build` â€” Build for production
- `npm start` â€” Start the production server
- `npm run lint` â€” Run ESLint

---

## Internationalization (i18n)

- Add new languages by creating a folder in `src/services/i18n/locales/` (e.g., `fr/` for French) and providing the necessary JSON translation files.
- The app will auto-detect and serve the correct language based on the URL and user preferences.

---

## Customization

- **Theming:** Edit `src/components/theme/theme-provider.tsx` for custom MUI themes.
- **API Endpoints:** Update API URLs in `src/services/api/config.ts` as needed.
- **Roles:** Adjust roles in `src/services/api/types/role.ts`.

---

## Linting & Pre-commit

- ESLint is configured with Next.js core web vitals.
- Husky runs `npm run lint` before every commit.
